<p class="story">

SPiCE provides easy access to visualization and classification methods for
sets of protein sequences. It can be used to calculate sequence-based protein
features, visualize feature data, and construct protein classifiers.

</p>

<p class="story">

SPiCE has been developed as part of <a
href="http://bioinformatics.tudelft.nl/users/bastiaan-van-den-berg">my</a> PhD
in the <a href="http://bioinformatics.tudelft.nl/">Delft Bioinformatics Lab</a>
at <a href="http://www.tudelft.nl/en">Delft University of Technology</a>. The
software was initialy used for the construction of a classifier that predicts
successful high-level secretion of proteins in <i>Asperigillus niger</i> (<a
href="#ref1">1</a>). To make feature exploration and classifier construction
methods generally accessible, we developed the SPiCE website as a user-friendly
graphical user interface to that software. SPiCE is described in the
following paper (<a href="#ref2">2</a>).
